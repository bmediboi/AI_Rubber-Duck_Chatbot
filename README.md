# AI_RubberDuck_Debugging_Chatbot

**Project Overview:**
The AI RubberDuck Debugging ChatBot revolutionizes the traditional rubber duck debugging method by incorporating an intelligent chatbot. Programmers describe their coding issues to the chatbot, which then provides tailored suggestions for solutions. This chatbot leverages advanced AI techniques to engage in iterative dialogues, probing deeper with each interaction to clarify and eventually pinpoint the root cause of errors. Itâ€™s designed to streamline the debugging process, making it more interactive and effective for developers at all levels.

**Team Members:**
- James Brouckman
- Balaji Mediboina
- John Mware

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive Dialogue:** Engages users in a conversation to explore the specifics of programming issues more deeply.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously refines its understanding and suggestions based on user feedback within the dialogue.
- **Dynamic Solution Suggestion:** Adapts its recommendations in real-time as more information is provided, ensuring precise and effective troubleshooting guidance.

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Significantly reduces the time spent on debugging by providing targeted advice and learning from interaction patterns.
- **Accessibility:** Offers support 24/7, aiding programmers during late-night coding sessions and tight deadlines.
- **Educational:** Enhances learning by explaining the reasoning behind each suggested solution, promoting better programming practices.

This tool is a dynamic and indispensable aid for developers seeking to optimize their debugging process, ensuring that solutions are not only suggested but thoroughly explained, facilitating continuous learning and development.
